					Angular Sessions

Angular: in angular code server side tech we r gng to get only data and then it is given to the client side.pages are designed in client side not in server side.
	 rest API(webservice) will connect to DAO layer and DAO connects to DB
website:interaction with user
webservice:interacts application to application
JSON format:stored in the form of (key,value)
rest API:reading data from diff technoligies ike java,python,.net and convert data into JSON format as we as XMl format. 
MAVEN build tool:it heps us to build a REST API project.
JERSEY library:it provides set of JAR files(like jstl jar file)


********************************************************************************************

ECILPSE:
create workspace
right click new - other-select MAVEN project
filter jersy - goto add archetype- goto googe - search jersy maven archetype-seect link-copy(given ink copy from it)
copy grpId and copy in 1st textbox
artifactId in 2nd textbox and version
OK
check in the filter
new mavan project
grpId - com.ts
arti:RESTAPI(projectId)-finish-wait unti the progress bar reaches 100%-u will get the project
*****if you did not get fies in the project right click on pom.xml(it adds the required jar fies) and then select maven and select Maven and select maven install****
attach apchetomcat to apche eclipse(buildpath-configurebuid path-ibrarirs-add ibrary-serverruntime-add apache)

when we run index.jsp we will get a webpage when we cick on jersey resource it wi dispay Got it it is predefined

from index.jsp it goes to web.xml and then to myresource.java
REStAPI>JAVARESOURSES>MyResource.java


*********************************************************************************************
Component:used to decorate webpage.It is ogica piece of code in angular application.
Angular heps us to run singe component in the page rather than whole page.

1)Template:HTM page
2)Class:Varibes,methods,constructors.

Typescript:Upper layer of java script.It is automatically converted into JS

Angular concepts:
----------------
1)components
2)Direcives
3)pipes
4)modules
5)service

One way data binding{{}}: accesing from typescript to view Component(html)(interpolation{{}})
Two way data binding   ->  Accesing data from View component to typescript(ngmodel)

***************************************************************************************
we  are using tyscript language in angular

1st version is AngularJS -> Javascript
other versions are Anguar2,3,4,5,6...(uses typescript)
Javascript:it is object based anguauge(only class & object)
typescript : it is OOP lang(class,object,inheritance,polymorphism)

every thing shoud be registered & imported in app.modue.ts

*********************************************************************************************

*authguard is used as a guard.if we use this the user can not enter other pages without
login.
 
COMMANDS:
*********
for running project      -  ng s --o
for creating component   -  ng g c component_name
for creating pipe        -  ng g p pipe_name
for creating authguard   -  ng g authguard_name
for removing unwanted things(spec.ts) while creating use --skip-tests
